In other words, Norway with their idea "The Call of our Forefathers" for example would not have to invest into Exploration ideas to spawn Colonialism if all the other requirements are fulfilled.
  - Estate Loan Privileges now require you to pay all your loans off to revoke. On the plus side: the privilege will revoke itself if you have no estates loans left to pay.
  - Improved the tooltip for the "Unguarded Nomadic Frontier" disaster so it takes less space on the screen.

  - The Imamete government name is no longer locked behind the Yemeni culture. Now it is available for every (Feudal) Theocratic Shia nation.
  - The Louisianan culture lost its last unnecessary "s".
  - The Trade Company Investment "Governor General’s Mansion” now increases your Manpower by a flat 2000 and your Sailors by a flat 400 instead of increasing your available Marines by 2%.

  - The disaster "French Wars of Religion" is no longer shown when you reach the Age of Absolutism as it can no longer trigger after the Age of Reformation anyway.

  - The estate privilege "Guaranteed Dhimmi Autonomy" gets no longer taken by the AI if they are a subject nation with an overlord which has religious ideas unlocked.
