# Expansion Features
###################
- Added Religious Reform system for new Nahuatl, Inti and Maya religions. Each of these religions have 5 reforms each that they can pass by achieving certain conditions. Upon passing all 5 reforms and bordering a Western country, they can reform their religion, which jumps them up on par with that Western country in technology and disables the special religion mechanics such as Doom and Authority. The reform bonuses are kept permanently even after reforming.
- Added Maya cycle mechanics. Maya countries can expand very rapidly to pass reforms, but upon passing a reform will collapse back into a smaller state. Each reform passed allows them to retain more territory on collapse.
- Added Inti authority mechanics. Inti countries will have a ticking authority value based on their size, and can use this value to pass religious reforms. Each reform they pass will spark a civil war, which if lose, revokes 2 reforms.
- Added Nahuatl doom mechanics. Non-subject countries with the Nahuatl religion will have a Doom value that ticks towards 100 based on their size, if it ever hits 100 they lose all monarch points, their ruler and heir dies, all subjects break free, they lose a religious reform and a 0/0/0 ruler takes over. Each reform passed makes Doom go up slower.
- Added events for Maya, Inti and Nahuatl religions.
- Now possible to create an entirely custom nation by clicking the 'Custom Nation' button during game setup. You can set your custom nation's starting location, provinces, culture, religion, government, ruling dynasty, national ideas and more. Up to 32 custom nations are supported in single and multiplayer.
- Added options for custom setup where you can randomize or flatten province base tax and manpower, play in an uncolonized world with only custom nations, or play with a world populated by randomly generated countries. 
- Colonial Nations will now accumulate the gold they get from their mines, no longer benefit from it themselves, but instead sending a treasure fleet to the homeland whenever enough gold has been accumulated.  Non-friendly privateers in the tradenode-path will steal parts of it, depending on privateer power.
- Larger Colonial Nations (10 provinces or more) now provide a merchant
- Fleets with with big & light ships can now be sent hunting pirates in trade nodes, reducing the privateer efficiency with up to 99% depending on gun ratio in the tradenode.
- Treaty of Tordesillas: The first catholic nation to form a colonial nation in a colonial region will now get a bonus to colonisation there, while other catholic nations gets penalties for colonising it.
- Can now set a conquistador in a colonial region to Hunt for the Seven Cities, this will make them automatically explore their surroundings in search of the legendary Seven Cities of Gold.
- Can now order a fleet with an explorer to circumnavigate the globe if diplo tech is at least 9, this will have it attempt a journey from the Straits of Magellan to the Cape of Good Hope. If it successfully makes the journey and you are the first to cirumnavigate the globe, you get 100 prestige and 40 naval tradition.
- Can now order fleets with explorers to automatically explore uncharted territories and coasts.
- You now get access to Privateers if you own El Dorado, even if you do not own Wealth of Nations as well.
