###################

# Diplomacy
- AI slightly more weights in neighbors that might declare on them in prewar power calculations.
- AI will now consider giving provinces to subject in peace even if they have vital interest on them.
- Made getting Friendly attitude from AI directly depend on opinion to a degree; this is an attempt to fix the bug that for unknown reasons made it very rare.
- AI overlord cancelling Tributary relation or being cancelled by overlord will have -1000 towards acceptance for the duration of the opinion modifier.

# Economy
- AI will now use Statute in Restraint of Appeals decision under limited circumstances. AI with this decision active will never reject Anglicanism.
- AI is now aware of more types of diplomatic expenses when performing budget calculations, hence less likely to underestimate budget.
- Free Thinker and Scholar personality rulers are more likely to Knowledge share.
- An AI country maxed out on tech will no longer try to advance to higher tech (this was reducing late game performance and preventing it from e.g. developing provinces instead).
- AI is now more keen to repair unmothballed ships during peace if they have no loans.
- AI is now able to decrease tariffs (again?)

- AI can now destroy buildings to build better ones if out of building slots when they are rich.

- Fixed AI massing on borders before declaring war (for immersion), if there isn't too high threat nearby.
- Trimmed down number of independent AI armies for countries with many regiments as this was being a performance drain.
- Tweaked non-tributary subjects declaring wars (colonial nations) to require a greater advantage, as to create fewer "overlord must rescue them" situations.
- Fixed issue where AI wouldn't merge many small transport fleets due to waiting for an admiral assignment it wouldn't decide to make anyway.
- AI made more likely to choose fort provinces as fleet bases to avoid easy capture.
- Added guard against AI launching doom stacking invasions into one province islands that already have enough troops (this works for any friendly units already arrived).
- AI will no longer use armies to explore when there are threats nearby said army.
- AI can now split their transport fleet when they feel safe about doing so and army to be transported is smaller than fleet.
- Fixed case where army would refuse to board transport because target location is held by enemy controller (really old code not making sense).

- Fixed cause of fleets stuck waiting for 0 unit armies.
- AI will try to keep a minimum fraction of its armies at home rather than sending them abroad to fight. This is however constrained by its splitting logic.
- Invading AI army stuck and unable to path to departure port will now disband. This is less bad than tying up a large part of the AI's force (including freed splinters).

- AI slightly more likely to assign leaders to main armies rather than splinters, and especially than divisions.
- AI can now simultaneously invade with multiple armies in same area provided there are enough enemies there (rather than exclusively with one army at a time).
- Fixed major bug in region assignment system that made most assignments fantasy comparatively speaking.
- Fixed invasion splinter consolidation behavior.
- Tightened up AIs use of repairing fleets for transport (especially, it will no longer assign such a fleet and then let army sit frozen and wait for it to repair).
