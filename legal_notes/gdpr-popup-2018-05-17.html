<p>Hello dear Paradox player!</p>

<p>We’ve recently updated our Privacy Policy and we want to explain to you why we’ve done this and what it means for you and your personal information. Please make sure to read this message so that you find out about changes that may be important to you.</p>

<p>Why update the Privacy Policy now?</p>

<p>To reflect the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - a legal act created to enhance your privacy rights. We are working hard to continue to earn your trust, and that’s why we want to keep up to date with best practices and tell you about some new changes to our Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>What has been changed in the Privacy Policy?</p>

<p>We’ve increased transparency. We’ve added some wording about what information we collect, how we collect it and how it is used in relation to our games and services.</p>

<p>We’ve improved navigation and use more user-friendly language. We’ve reformatted our policy with clearer language, headings, and links that allow you to find important information more easily. Where we can, we’ve added examples that illustrate our activities.</p>

<p>We are giving you more control over your information. We have added information about how we share information and why we do it. We are making it easier for you to control the information you provide us with. Our policy explains how you can make choices about your information and the measures we’ve put in place to keep your information secure.</p>

<p>How are the updates being implemented?</p>

<p>We are notifying you here about these changes and providing you with the updated version of our Privacy Policy. You just need to click on the link below to access it. The new Policy will take effect as soon as you have received this message.</p>
